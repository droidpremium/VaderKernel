VaderKernel
===========

This is the first Custom Kernel built by source for the Micromax A89!


This Kernel will modify your ROM's System.  And this will only be meant to flash on Micromax A89!  Flashing on any other
devices may cause a bootloop or brick.

Note that all builds may not be flashable as I do not own the device and I will constantly be trying to port different
features to this Kernel.

This is also apart of the Android Open Source Project so you can use this kernel for any way you want.  In ROMs, Mods,
Ect...  All I ask is that you give me proper credit where needed!!

This source is not built from an official A89 source.  This will be a port of a source from a clone device!  Errors may
occur and Dual-Sim may not work!!

If you run across errors then please flash my Original Stock-Modded Kernel (Vortex Kernel).  That will fix all your
issues and bring you back to pretty much stock.

I appreciate anybody and everybody that will support me during this development!
